SCRIPT TYPE: Talking Head

Two 2x4s, about nine bucks at Lowe's, and twenty little shelf brackets you can sell. Prices subject to change.

Grab two 2x4x8 boards. Pick through the pile for the straightest ones. Cut each board into 16-inch pieces. Flip them. Sand the edges.

===START CTA(100 Ways to Make Your First $1,000 with Woodworking)===
Quick one. Every measurement for this bracket, plus a hundred more projects, is in my digital book, first link in the description. Back to the cut.
===END CTA===

Number two. Clamp a stop block at five and three-quarters inches, and let the blade stop before you lift it, so the offcut can't kick back.

These are listed between 14 and 22 dollars on Etsy, and I'd list them around 18.

===START CTA(100 Ways to Make Your First $1,000 with Woodworking)===
The book's in the description if you want the other ninety-nine. Subscribe so the next build shows up in your feed.
===END CTA===

Cut one board this weekend and see what it turns into.
